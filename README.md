# ToL-Mod-Utility
Moderation utility for Throne of Lies player reports.

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

This tool I made was used to process player reports for the online game "Throne of Lies" before its ingame report processing system was implemented.

It was a hobby project I voluntarily took upon myself during the time I was serving as Moderator for its community hubs and the game itself. Its functions served to easen processing reports against players that broke the game's rules.

This tool is no longer of any use with the inception of the ingame system. You can download its source or its releases, but the only thing you will be able to do is sift through the anonymized example logs I provide here.

| NOTICE: Everything said by any of the players involved in the provided logs is the opinion of the player alone. I am not personally involved in any of it and do not support the opinions expressed in them. The anonymized chat logs are provided solely for being able to test the Utility being provided here. |

I also provide example usage videos in [this](https://github.com/robflop/ToL-Mod-Utility/tree/master/concepts_demonstration) folder. Have a look at these if you do not wish to try it out yourself.
